          <h5>VISA APPLICATION PROCESS FOR GERMANY FROM INDIA</h5>

          <p>
            After you have completed your application form, you will have to
            make an appointment with the German visa application centre. Once
            there you have to ensure all your documents are stacked in the order
            mentioned in the checklist and that you have completed and signed
            your form. The papers and application you submit will then be
            verified. If your application is incomplete or a document is
            missing, this whole process will be restarted.
          </p>

          <p>
            Once your papers have been checked, you will receive a printed copy
            of your application that you will sign and will then be required to
            pay for the visa. Once this is done your biometric details will be
            collected. This is the last step in the process, and you will then
            have to wait to hear back from the Consulate when the visa is
            processed.
          </p>
