          <h4>VISA APPLICATION PROCESS</h4>
          <img
            src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/1239162/pexels-photo-1239162.jpeg?cs=srgb&dl=pexels-mikel-1239162.jpg&fm=jpg"
            alt="US visa application form"
          />
          <p>
            There are a variety of US visas that a candidate can apply for.
            Here, we have mentioned some of the most applied for US visas for
            immigration. Once you have applied for your visa, if you qualify,
            you’ll be provided with a Green Card. A person who is possess a
            Green Card is a permanent resident of US.
          </p>

          <h5>Employment Offer (H1-B):</h5>
          <p>
            If you have an employment offer from a US employer, then you can
            file an application for a Green Card. In turn, the employer will
            have to sponsor you by filling in the I-140 Form. Though this visa,
            you’ll come to the US as a skilled worker. US EB-5 Visa: As the
            applicants of H1B visa have risen in the past few years, most
            candidates have started applying for a US EB-5 visa. For this visa,
            you need to invest a certain amount of money in a business based in
            the US. Applicants are allowed to live and work in the US while
            their application is being processed. This visa came into vogue this
            year and has far fewer applicants than H1B visa holders. Apart from
            these, there are special status jobs. If you are working in these
            jobs and have all the required credentials then you can easily get
            your Green Card. If you aren’t eligible for any of the
            aforementioned visa categories, then you can apply for Green Card
            Lottery Programs.
          </p>
