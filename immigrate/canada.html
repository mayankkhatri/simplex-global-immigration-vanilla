          <h4>What are the pathways to get PR in Canada from India?</h4>
          <p>
            Below are five sought after ways to immigrate to Canada as a
            permanent resident. They are described as follows:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Express Entry Program</strong> - Launched in 2015, Express
              Entry is an online application management system that governs all
              federal streams under economic migration programs, which includes
              Federal Skilled Worker, Canadian Experience Class, and Federal
              Skilled Trades. Under this system, people who wish to live and
              work in Canada, and who meet the minimum eligibility requirements
              may submit an expression of interest in applying for permanent
              residence by creating an online profile.
              <p>
                Every profile under the Express Entry is given a Comprehensive
                Ranking System (CRS) score that is further used to rank
                applicants against each other in the pool. The higher the
                scores, the better are the chances for receiving an Invitation
                to Apply from Immigration, Refugees, and Citizenship Canada
                (IRCC).
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Canada Provincial Nominee Programs</strong> - The Canadian
              government has given its provinces rights in selecting economic
              immigrants and inviting them to permanently settle in Canada.
              Every province in Canada has its own levels of guidelines and
              selection criteria to pick candidates to address labor shortage
              needs of that particular province. All these provincial
              immigration streams are popularly known as Provincial Nominee
              Programs (PNPs).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Quebec Skilled Worker Program</strong> - As compared to
              any other Canadian province, Quebec enjoys a high degree of
              authority to set its own rules for immigration. Presently, no
              Quebec immigration stream is aligned with Express Entry. However,
              candidates may choose to apply directly for the Quebec Skilled
              Worker Program, the Quebec Experience Class, and Quebec Business
              Immigration.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Student Pathway</strong>- Student pathway is a definitive
              choice for any one who is not eligible for any of the immigration
              streams mentioned above. Interested candidates may choose to study
              in Canada as the credentials they gain while studying here can
              instantly improve their chances for obtaining Canada PR visa.
              Since many immigration programs give preference to Canadian
              student experience, studying in Canada can be an ideal way to get
              a Canadian permanent resident status.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Start-up Visa</strong>-This visa category is suitable for
              high net-worth entrepreneurs who want to set up a new business in
              Canada. For this, they must get their business or business idea
              sponsored by an authorized body in Canada and thus migrate to the
              country permanently.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Family Sponsorship</strong>- Family reunification is the
              second most popular way of migrating to Canada permanently. If you
              are married to person or have a child who is a Canadian citizen,
              they can sponsor you to come to Canada. The only condition is that
              the sponsor must be financially strong enough to support you in
              Canada.
            </li>
          </ol>

            whether you have a valid job offer, English and/or French language
            skills as well as adaptability how well you’re likely to settle
