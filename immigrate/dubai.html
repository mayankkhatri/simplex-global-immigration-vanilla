          <img
            src="https://www.hw.ac.uk/dubai/img/dubai-waterfront-800x450.jpg"
            alt="Burj Khalifa in Dubai"
          />
          <p>
            Dubai, due to its strategic geographical location and plentiful oil
            reserves, is one of the most developed states in the world. The
            luxurious ambiance coalesced with affordable housing, makes it a
            great destination for immigrants. A cornucopia of shopping
            complexes, hotels, and adventure parks enable residents to enjoy
            their life.
          </p>

          <p>
            Still, the best thing about Dubai is Tax-Free Salary. Yes, you read
            it right. There is no income tax in Dubai, so you’ll keep all the
            money you get. Further, purchase of amenities is untaxed, thus
            giving you additional purchasing power.
          </p>

          <p>
            Cultural diversity in Dubai will enable you to taste cuisines from
            all around the globe. Further, you’ll find it easier to integrate
            into the society. Despite being an Islamic city-state, the rules and
            regulations are lax. You can, without any interruption practice your
            religion. Also, there are plenty of temple, mosques, churches, etc
            in Dubai.
          </p>

          <p>
            The money from oil enabled Dubai to construct state of the art
            infrastructure. Burj Khalifa embodies a pinnacle of human
            achievement. Plus, the connectivity around the state is good. You
            don’t have to purchase or even rent an automobile. You can always
            get a taxi.
          </p>
