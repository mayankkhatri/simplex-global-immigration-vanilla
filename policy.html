        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>6. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
      <p>
        We do not sell your personal information. We may share your information

      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>

      <h2>7. International Data Transfers</h2>
      <p>
        As an immigration services provider, processing your application will
        inherently involve transferring your personal information to countries
        outside of India, specifically to the country/countries to which you are
        applying for immigration. We will ensure that such transfers are
        necessary for the performance of our services (contractual necessity) or
        are made with your explicit consent, and that appropriate safeguards are
        considered where applicable law requires.
      </p>

      <h2>8. Data Security</h2>
      <p>
        We implement reasonable administrative, technical, and physical security
        measures designed to protect your personal information from unauthorized
        access, use, alteration, or disclosure. These measures include
        encryption, access controls, secure servers, and staff training.
        However, please note that no method of transmission over the Internet or
        method of electronic storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee
        absolute security.
      </p>

      <h2>9. Data Retention</h2>
      <p>
        We will retain your personal information only for as long as necessary
        to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, including for the
        purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements,
        or as required to resolve disputes. The retention period may vary
        depending on the nature of the information and the context of our
        relationship with you. Once the retention period expires, we will
        securely delete or anonymize your information.
      </p>
